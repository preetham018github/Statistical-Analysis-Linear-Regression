## Key Objectives

### Linear Regression

Predict car prices based on features like mileage, engine volume, year of manufacture, and fuel type.

Understand the theoretical foundation of Linear Regression and its assumptions.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Conduct residual analysis and validate assumptions for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

### Logistic Regression
Classify binary outcomes using Logistic Regression.

Preprocess and clean datasets for effective modeling.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualize classification results and assess model reliability.

## Steps Covered

### Linear Regression

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered patterns and relationships in the dataset.

Model Development: Built and evaluated the Linear Regression model.

Model Validation: Performed residual analysis to validate the assumptions of OLS.

Conclusions: Derived actionable insights and identified limitations.

### Logistic Regression

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and split datasets into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored data relationships and visualized patterns.

Model Development: Built and evaluated the Logistic Regression model.

Performance Evaluation: Assessed the model using classification metrics and visualized results.

Conclusions: Summarized insights and potential improvements.

## Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Results

### Linear Regression
The Linear Regression model successfully predicts car prices, demonstrating an acceptable level of accuracy and adherence to OLS assumptions.

### Logistic Regression
The Logistic Regression model effectively classifies binary outcomes, with robust evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC validating its performance.
