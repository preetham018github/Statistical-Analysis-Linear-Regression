# Statistical Analysis: Regression Techniques Implementation and Evaluation

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict the prices of used cars based on multiple features such as mileage, engine volume, year of manufacture, and fuel type. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and exploratory data analysis is performed to derive meaningful insights before building the regression model.

### Key Objectives

Understand Linear Regression:
Grasp the theoretical framework of Linear Regression.
Implement the model using Python libraries like scikit-learn and statsmodels.

Explore Data Relationships:
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the dataset.
Handle missing values and prepare data for modeling.

Evaluate Model Assumptions:
Test the assumptions of OLS, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.

Analyze Model Performance:
Use metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model.
Perform residual analysis to validate the reliability of predictions.

### Steps Covered

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize data distributions and correlations.
Detect and address outliers.

Model Development:
Fit the Linear Regression model using Python libraries.
Compare results from different modeling approaches.

Model Validation:
Examine residuals and other diagnostics to ensure adherence to OLS assumptions.

Conclusions:
Present actionable insights derived from the model.
Identify limitations and propose potential enhancements.

### Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Results
The model successfully predicts car prices with an acceptable level of accuracy, demonstrating the viability of linear regression for this use case.
